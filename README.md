<h2>TO DO: </h2>

* Use feature engineering to build better more relevant features.
* Find most optimal way to fill in missing ages (Eg: Use regression algorithm using other attributes).
* Find better alternative to one hot encoding.
* Deep Learning Techniques.

<h2>INSTALLATION:</h2>

* Download Titanic.py and datasets folder.
* Run Titanic.py.
